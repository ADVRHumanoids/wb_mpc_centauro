If you want to deploy the mpc on a xbotcore2-powered robot there are specific thing you should take care of:

- The xbot2 configuration can affect the deployment, in particular the frequency at which xbotcore is running.
You can see which config you are using by doing `get_xbot2_config` on a terminal. We suggest first using one 
of the configs in folder gazebo_ocs2_ros_interfaces/config which where used for all the experiments, e.g.
centauro_dagana_mpc.yaml. You can set this by doing `set_xbot2_config centauro_dagana_mpc.yaml` on a terminal.

- Every time you start the mpc you should make sure that xbotcore filtering is applied. This can be done by
selecting the cutoff option at xbot2-gui. It should be "safe". This is necessary because some kind of smoothing
is needed between the first mpc references and the previous ones at the joint level.

- After having started the mpc you can change the cutoff to medium or fast. Indeed for very dynamic motions
filtering can cause large delays on forwarding the references to the actuators. Therefore, make sure to select
"fast" at the xbot2-gui after you have run the mpc and before sending the dynamic gait command.

- Before deployment on hw we suggest first making sure the base estimation is working decently. For doing this
run your base estimation algorithm and check that the robot state is correct. For centauro you can do this with
`roslaunch base_estimation centauro_base_estimation.launch` and then opening rviz for visualizing wrt the
`odometry/world` frame.
